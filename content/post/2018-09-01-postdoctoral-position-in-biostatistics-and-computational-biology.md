Applications are invited for a postdoctoral position in the Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology at the University of Rochester Medical Center under the supervision of Dr. Matthew N McCall. The postdoctoral associate will work as part of a collaborative team of Biostatisticians, Computational Biologists, and Biomedical Geneticists to advance our understanding of complex biological systems by developing and applying statistical methods that quantify both biological and technical sources of variation.

**Position qualifications:** The successful applicant should have recently completed a PhD and have training in biostatistics, bioinformatics, computational biology, or a related field. Candidates with a background in the biological sciences and strong quantitative skills are also encouraged to apply. Experience with statistical programming in R is desirable. Preference will be given to candidates that demonstrate a desire to work in a collaborative multi-disciplinary environment.

**Appointment:** This position is initially available for one year with the possibility of renewal based on performance, availability of funds for salary support, and a mutual desire to continue the appointment. The start date for this position is flexible. 

**To apply:** Applicants should email a single PDF containing a short statement of research interests, contact information for three references, and a current CV to:
