The Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology at the University of Rochester (UR) announces an opening for a postdoctoral traineeship in Environmental Health (EH) Biostatistics, funded by an NIEHS T32 training grant. The appointee will develop and apply novel statistical methodology for projects related to EH, under the mentorship of a Biostatistics faculty trainer (Drs. Sally W. Thurston, Matthew N. McCall, Brent Johnson, Tanzy Love, Michael McDermott, David Oakes, or Robert Strawderman).  The specific methodological focus may be based in part on the trainee’s interests, and will involve co-mentorship from a leading environmental health researcher.  Examples of EH topics include studies of (1) the associations between air pollution exposure and biomarkers thought to indicate increased risk of future cardiac events; (2) effects of pre- and post-natal mercury exposure from fish consumption on multiple outcomes in childhood and adolescence; (3) RNA sequencing to quantify the effect of dioxin exposure on CD8+ T-cell gene expression accounting for an unknown mixture of responders and non-responders; and (4) methods to quantify morphologic changes in microglia in response to pharmacological alterations of noradrenergic signaling in the brain.  Methodological expertise among T32 faculty trainers includes Bayesian MCMC methods, models for multiple outcomes, latent variable models, measurement error, missing data, causal inference, survival analysis, clustering, statistical genomics, molecular systems biology, and bioinformatics.  The appointee will also receive training in advanced biostatistics and in toxicology, and be involved in other collaborative work with EH researchers.

**Position qualifications:** In accordance with NIEHS requirements, trainees must be a US citizen or permanent resident, and must have completed a doctoral degree in statistics or a related subject by the appointment start date.  We seek a highly motivated candidate with a strong statistical background, excellent programming skills and good communication.  

**Appointment:** The position is available for 12 months initially with the possibility of renewal for a second year. We anticipate an early autumn 2018 start date, but seek the best candidate even if the start date is delayed.  

**To apply:** A cover letter describing research experience, a current CV and contact information for three references should be sent by email to Sally_Thurston@urmc.rochester.edu (please reference “NIEHS postdoctoral position” in the subject line).
