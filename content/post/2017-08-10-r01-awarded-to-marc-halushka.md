Dr. Marc Halushka's R01, *Fine Dissection of Atherosclerosis Microenvironment RNA Expression*, has been funded! The proposed research represents the first in-depth analysis of expression in human coronary atherosclerotic plaques to uncover cell-specific gene expression differences. 

The McCall Lab has received a subcontract to analyze transcriptomic data from the cell types present in an atherosclerotic plaque and assess the ability of mRNA- and miRNA-seq to distinguish between cell types. We will estimate the cellular composition of ~800 GTEx coronary artery samples. This will allow us to identify gene and regulatory element expression alterations that vary across atherosclerotic plaque types of the coronary arteries.
